This doc is to provide information on the code structure of ACRONYM's CLI front end.

All sourcecode for ACRONYM is kept within src/. acronym.py provides the tool itself,
and depends on the python modules and python packages contained in src/. Because
ACRONYM has a package management system for sample construction packages, python
modules and python packages should generally be referred to as pymodules and
pypackages to avoid confusion.

src/cli.py provides a class for the active user session and any helper functions
thereof. commands are loaded into the user session from whichever package those
commands pertain to. e.g. commands that handle live samples are defined in samples/.
The convention for writing runnable commands and loading them into the user session
is documented in cli.py.

src/core/ provides "core" commands that concern the user's active session.

src/sample/ provides abstractions for dealing with live samples, such as building
and loading, adding/removing/editing components, etc. and the commands for working
with such actions.

src/template/ provides mechanisms for translating live samples, which exist only as
python objects in memory, into sourcecode on the disk and vice versa.
